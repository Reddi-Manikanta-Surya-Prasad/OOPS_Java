OOPS Fundamentals:
Overview of OOPS
Objects and Classes
Pillars of OOPS:
1. Data Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
    Types of Inheritance Single, Multiple etc.
4. Polymorphism
    Static Polymorphism
    Dynamic Polymorphism
Relationship
    Is-a-Relationship
    Has-a-Relationship

OOPS: Object Oriented Programming
-> Here Object means a real world entity like Bike, Car and ATM etc.

Procedural Programming VS OOPS
Procedural:
1. Programming is divided into parts called functions.
2. Does not provide proper way to hide data, gives importance tro functions and data moves freely.
3. Overloading is not possible.
4. Inheritance is not possible.
5. Code reusability is not possible.
Examples: FASCAL, C, FORTRAN etc.

OOPS:
1. Program is divided into Objects
2. Objects provide data hiding and gives importance to data.
3. Overloading is possible.
4. Inheritance is possible.
5. Code reusability is present.
Examples: Java, C++, Python, C# etc.

Obejcts and Classes
Obejcts has 2 things:
1. Propoerties or states
2. behaviour or Function

Example:
Dog is an Object because it has 
Properties like Age, Breed, Color etc.
Behaviours like Bark, Sleep, Eat etc.

Car is an Object becuase it has 
Properties like Color, Type, Brand, Weight etc.
Behavious like Apply Brakes, Drive Increase speed etc.
